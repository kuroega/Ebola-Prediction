# Ebola-Prediction
The final project of Intro to Machine Learning (EL-GY 9123)

Since **Ebola Virus** busted out to be a super threat to the human being in all over the world, we have a concern about the future of our life. The undergoing medical research may also be assisted by the prediction of the virus spreading. In our project, we conducted a simple but dedicated approach to predict the virus versus the temperature of the locations/ countries that have reported confirmed Ebola cases. 
The following are the basic steps to run the project in this notebook

1. Load data source 
2. Cleanse data format and extract data
3. Test data using different models
4. Data visualization
